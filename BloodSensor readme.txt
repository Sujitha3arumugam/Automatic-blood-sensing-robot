BloodSensor and Motor Control
This repository contains two Java classes: BloodSensor and Motor. These classes are designed for simulating blood level readings and motor control.

BloodSensor
The BloodSensor class generates random blood level values between 0 and 100 when the readBloodLevel() method is called.

Motor
The Motor class provides methods for motor activation and deactivation, with corresponding messages printed to indicate their status.
